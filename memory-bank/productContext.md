# Product Context: Local Crawler Microservice

## Purpose

The Local Crawler Microservice serves as a crucial component in our system by providing a reliable and efficient way to scan, catalog, and monitor local media files. It bridges the gap between the file system and other services that need to work with media metadata.

## Problems Solved

1. **File Discovery**
   - Automated discovery of media files across multiple directories
   - Elimination of manual file tracking and cataloging
   - Prevention of duplicate file processing

2. **Metadata Management**
   - Centralized storage of file metadata
   - Consistent metadata extraction across all files
   - Easy access to file information without direct file system access

3. **System Integration**
   - Standardized API for file system operations
   - Decoupled file access from business logic
   - Simplified integration with other microservices

## User Experience Goals

1. **For Developers**
   - Simple API integration
   - Clear documentation
   - Predictable behavior
   - Robust error handling
   - Easy debugging and monitoring

2. **For System Administrators**
   - Simple deployment via Docker
   - Configurable through environment variables
   - Comprehensive logging
   - Clear operational metrics
   - Easy backup and restore processes

3. **For End Users** (via other services)
   - Fast file metadata retrieval
   - Accurate file information
   - No duplicates in processed files
   - Minimal system impact during scanning

## Key Features

1. **Directory Scanning**
   - Configurable directory paths
   - File type filtering
   - Recursive scanning
   - Progress tracking
   - Scan status reporting

2. **Metadata Processing**
   - File hash calculation
   - Image dimension extraction
   - Creation/modification date tracking
   - MIME type detection
   - Error logging for problematic files

3. **API Endpoints**
   - Scan initiation
   - Status checking
   - Results querying
   - Health monitoring
   - Configuration management

## Integration Points

1. **File System**
   - Read-only access via Docker volumes
   - Support for various file systems
   - Path normalization
   - Access error handling

2. **Database**
   - Metadata storage
   - Query optimization
   - Transaction management
   - Data integrity maintenance

3. **Other Microservices**
   - RESTful API communication
   - Status notifications
   - Error propagation
   - Data format standardization

## Success Metrics

1. **Performance**
   - Scan completion time
   - API response time
   - Resource utilization
   - Database query performance

2. **Reliability**
   - Error rate
   - Service uptime
   - Data accuracy
   - Recovery time

3. **Usability**
   - API adoption rate
   - Documentation clarity
   - Configuration simplicity
   - Integration ease

## Future Considerations

1. **Scalability**
   - Support for larger file systems
   - Distributed scanning
   - Increased concurrent requests
   - Enhanced caching

2. **Feature Expansion**
   - Additional file type support
   - Advanced metadata extraction
   - Real-time file monitoring
   - Enhanced search capabilities

3. **Integration Enhancement**
   - Event-driven updates
   - Webhook support
